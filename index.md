**WHAT IS ATLANTIVE?**

Get connected and stay connected. Atlantive speeds up idea to outcome, engaging teams and bridging the gap between your ideas, data, people, metrics and outcomes. 

Your organization is full of great people and their ideas; you have data and metrics. But there is a challenge, those people reside across teams, departments and geographies; their ideas live everywhere, hidden in presentations, documents and scribbled on pieces of paper.  Your data is stored in databases, spreadsheets and hidden away in reports.  Ideas never co-exist with their associated data and metrics, it is slow and difficult to get your ideas articulated, approved and pushed into build and even harder to identify and justify their outcomes.  

We believe in better, faster.  Atlantive is an app, we live in the cloud and we take business and IT agility to the next level.  With Atlantive you donâ€™t miss a beat, you keep what is key to succeed and you get to success fast.  We do what we say, we learn, we get better, faster.
