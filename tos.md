**Atlantive Customer Agreement**

**_ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS_**
IMPORTANT -- READ CAREFULLY: BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT OR BY UTILIZING THE ATLANTIVE CLOUD SERVICES YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.


Effective starting: October 1, 2016 

This Atlantive Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between you and Atlantive Pty Ltd (ABN xxxxxx) (“Atlantive”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then “Customer” or “you” means your company, and you are binding your company to this Agreement. Atlantive may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject to the terms in Section 20 (Changes to this Agreement) below.

**1 Scope of the Agreement**. This Agreement governs your initial purchase as well as any future purchases made by you that reference this Agreement. This Agreement includes our Privacy Policy, our Acceptable Use Policy, any Orders, and any other referenced policies and attachments. 

**2 Atlantive Service**. This Agreement governs Atlantive’s cloud-based service (“Cloud Services”).  Section 6 (Cloud Services Terms) applies specifically to Cloud Services, but unless otherwise specified, other provisions of this Agreement apply to all Atlantive Services.

**3 Account Registration**. You may need to register for an Atlantive account in order to place orders or access or receive any Cloud Services. Any registration information that you provide to us must be accurate, current and complete. You must also update your information so that we may send notices, statements and other information to you by email or through your account. You are responsible for all actions taken through your accounts.

**4 Orders**.

4.1 Directly with Atlantive. Atlantive’s Cloud Services ordering documentation or purchase flow (“Order”) will specify your authorized scope of use for the Cloud Services, which may include: (a) number and type of Authorized Users (as defined below), (b) storage or capacity (for Cloud Services) , or (d) other restrictions or billable units (as applicable, the “Scope of Use”). The term “Order” also includes any applicable Cloud Services renewal, or purchases you make to increase or upgrade your Scope of Use.

**5 Authorized Users**. Only the specific individuals for whom you have paid the required fees and whom you designate through the Atlantive Cloud Service (“Authorized Users”) may access and use the Cloud Service. Some Cloud Services may allow you to designate different types of Authorized Users, in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of Authorized User. Authorized Users may be you or your Affiliates’ employees, representatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third parties who are acting for your benefit or on your behalf.  You may increase the number of Authorized Users permitted to access your instance of the Cloud Service by placing a new Order or, in some cases, directly through the Product. In all cases, you must pay the applicable fee for the increased number of Authorized Users. You are responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all Authorized Users. All use of Atlantive Cloud Services by you and your Authorized Users must be within the Scope of Use and solely for the benefit of you or your Affiliates. “Affiliate” means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a party, where “control” means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.

**6 Cloud Services Terms**.

6.1 Access to Cloud Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Atlantive grants you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Cloud Services during the applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in accordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the Documentation. If Atlantive offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) for any Cloud Service, you may use such software solely with the Cloud Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You acknowledge that our Cloud Services are on-line, subscription-based products and that we may make changes to the Cloud Services from time to time.

6.2 Subscription Terms and Renewals. Cloud Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term specified in your Order (“Subscription Term”). Subscription Terms are set at a minimum of 12 months and are available in 12 month increments. Except as otherwise specified in your Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates) unless you cancel your subscription by sending notice of cancellation to AtlantiveHQ@Atlantive.com no less than 30 days in advance of the end of your current Term. If you cancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.

6.3 Credentials. You must ensure that all Authorized Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Services strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared. You are responsible for any and all actions taken using your accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify Atlantive of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.

6.4 Your Data. “Your Data” means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any type that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through Cloud Services. You will retain all right, title and interest in and to Your Data in the form provided to Atlantive. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Atlantive a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to (a) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the extent necessary to provide the applicable Cloud Service to you and (b) for Cloud Services that enable you to share Your Data or interact with other people, to distribute and publicly perform and display Your Data as you (or your Authorized Users) direct or enable through the Cloud Service. Atlantive may also access your account or instance in order to respond to your support requests.

6.5 Security. Atlantive implements security procedures to help protect Your Data from security attacks. However, you understand that use of the Cloud Services necessarily involves transmission of Your Data over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks. We cannot guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Data will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers.

6.6 Storage Limits. There may be storage limits associated with a particular Cloud Service. Atlantive reserves the right to charge for additional storage or overage fees at the rates specified on our website. We may impose new, or may modify existing, storage limits for the Cloud Services at any time in our discretion, with or without notice to you.

6.7 Responsibility for Your Data.

6.7.1 General. You must ensure that your use of Cloud Services and all Your Data is at all times compliant with our Acceptable Usage Policy and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (“Laws”). You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to provide all Your Data to Atlantive and to grant the rights granted to Atlantive in this Agreement and (ii) Your Data and its transfer to and use by Atlantive as authorized by you under this Agreement do not violate any Laws (including without limitation those relating to export control and electronic communications) or rights of any third party, including without limitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorized herein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy policies. Other than its security obligations under Section 6.5 (Security), Atlantive assumes no responsibility or liability for Your Data, and you shall be solely responsible for Your Data and the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.

6.7.2 Sensitive Data. You will not submit to the Cloud Services (or use the Cloud Services to collect): (i) any personally identifiable information, except as necessary for the establishment of your Atlantive account; (ii) any patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by HIPAA or any similar federal or state laws, rules or regulations; or (iii) any other information subject to regulation or protection under specific laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or related rules or regulations) ((i) through (iii), collectively, “Sensitive Data”). You also acknowledge that Atlantive is not acting as your Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined and used in HIPAA) and that the Cloud Services are not HIPAA compliant. “HIPAA” means the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended and supplemented. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Atlantive has no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Data.

6.7.3 Indemnity for Your Data. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Atlantive from and against any loss, cost, liability or damage, including legal fees, for which Atlantive becomes liable arising from or relating to any claim relating to Your Data, including but not limited to any claim brought by a third party alleging that Your Data, or your use of the Cloud Services in breach of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law. This indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Atlantive at your expense.

6.8 Removals and Suspension. Atlantive has no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Cloud Services. Nonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of this Agreement, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Cloud Services or (2) suspend your access to the Cloud Services. We will generally alert you when we take such action and give you a reasonable opportunity to cure your breach, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Service or other users, we may suspend your access immediately without notice. You will continue to be charged for the Cloud Service during any suspension period. We have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Services as described in this section.

6.9 Deletion at End of Subscription Term. We may remove or delete Your Data within a reasonable period of time after the termination of your Subscription Term.

**7 Returns and Financial Terms**.

7.1 Return Policy. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, it is our customary business practice to allow customers a full Cloud Services refund within 30 days of payment for any reason or no reason. A return means that we will disable access to the Cloud Service. We will not accept returns after the 30-day return period. You understand that Atlantive may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 20 (Changes to this Agreement).

7.2 Delivery. We will deliver the login instructions for the Atlantive Cloud Service to the email addresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the applicable fees. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic. 

7.3 Payment. You agree to pay all fees in accordance with each Order. Unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will pay all amounts in Australian (AU) dollars at the time you place your Order. Other than as expressly set forth in Section 7.1 (Return Policy), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. In making payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of any Cloud Services beyond the current Subscription Term or any upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add Authorized Users during your Cloud Services Subscription Term, we will charge you for the increased number of Authorized Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill your credit card for renewals, additional users, and unpaid fees, as applicable. If you purchase Atlantive Cloud Services through a Reseller, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your rights to use Atlantive Cloud Services if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller.

7.4 Taxes. Your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Services in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Atlantive, you must pay to Atlantive the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed. In that case, you will have the right to provide to Atlantive any such exemption information, and Atlantive will use reasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable you to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant revenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.

**8 No-Charge Cloud Services**. We may offer certain Cloud Services to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“No-Charge Cloud Services”). Your use of No-Charge Cloud Services is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us. You may not use No-Charge Cloud Services for competitive analysis or similar purposes. We may terminate your right to use No-Charge Cloud Services at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products we make available (“Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 8 (No-Charge Cloud Services). All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes Atlantive’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Cloud Services, including any Support and Maintenance, warranty, and indemnity obligations.

**9 Restrictions**. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not: (a) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the Atlantive Cloud Services to a third party, (b) use the Cloud Services for the benefit of any third party, (c) incorporate any Cloud Services into a product or service you provide to a third party, (d) interfere with or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Cloud Services intended to limit your use, (e) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Cloud Services, except as permitted by law, (f) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Cloud Service, or (g) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Services.

**10 Ownership and Feedback**. Cloud Services are made available on an access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”. Atlantive have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Cloud Services (including all No-Charge Cloud Services), their “look and feel”, any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing created by or for Atlantive, including without limitation as they may incorporate customer Feedback.  From time to time, you may choose to submit comments, information, questions, data, ideas, description of processes, or other information to Atlantive, including sharing Your Modifications or in the course of receiving Support and Maintenance (“Feedback”). Atlantive may in connection with any of its Cloud Services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement limits Atlantive's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

**11 Confidentiality**. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure. Any Atlantive Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Services shall be deemed Confidential Information of Atlantive without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving Party's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not operate as a separate warranty with respect to the operation of any Product.

**12 Term and Termination**. This Agreement is in effect for as long as you have a valid Subscription Term (the “Term”), unless sooner terminated as permitted in this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party materially breaches any of the terms of this Agreement and does not cure the breach within thirty (30) days after written notice of the breach. Either party may also terminate the Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other party ceases to operate, declares bankruptcy, or becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to meet its financial obligations. You may terminate this Agreement at any time with notice to Atlantive, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds as a result of convenience termination for prepaid but unused Cloud Services subscriptions. Except where an exclusive remedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise. Once the Agreement terminates, you (and your Authorized Users) will no longer have any right to use or access any Cloud Services, or any information or materials that we make available to you under this Agreement, including Atlantive Confidential Information. You are required to delete any of the foregoing from your systems as applicable (including any third party systems operated on your behalf) and provide written certification to us that you have done so at our request. The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement: Sections 7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data), 7.3 (Payment), 7.4 (Taxes), 8 (No-Charge Products) (disclaimers and use restrictions only), 9 (Restrictions), 10 (Ownership and Feedback), 11 (Confidentiality), 12 (Term and Termination), 13.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 14 (Limitation of Liability), 15 (Third Party Vendor Products), 18 (Governing Law), 19 (Export Restrictions), and 21 (General Provisions).

**13 Warranty and Disclaimer**.

13.1 Due Authority. Each party represents and warrants that it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and that, if you are an entity, this Agreement and each Order is entered into by an employee or agent of such party with all necessary authority to bind such party to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

13.2 WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. ALL CLOUD SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND ATLANTIVE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY, OR MERCHANTABILITY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW. ATLANTIVE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF ATLANTIVE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER ATLANTIVE NOR ANY OF ITS THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE AS TO THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, TRUTH, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY CLOUD SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT THEREIN OR GENERATED THEREWITH, OR THAT: (A) THE USE OF ANY CLOUD SERVICES WILL BE SECURE, TIMELY, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (B) THE CLOUD SERVICES WILL OPERATE IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR DATA; (C) THE CLOUD SERVICES (OR ANY CLOUD SERVICES,  INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE CLOUD SERVICES) WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS); (D) ANY STORED DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR THAT ANY STORED DATA WILL NOT BE LOST OR CORRUPTED; (E) ERRORS OR DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR (F) THE CLOUD SERVICES (OR ANY SERVER(S) THAT MAKE A CLOOUD SERVICE AVAILABLE) ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

**14 Limitation of Liability**. NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, COSTS OF DELAY OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. NEITHER PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO US FOR PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS SHALL BE US$20. THIS SECTION 19 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) SHALL NOT APPLY TO (1) AMOUNTS OWED BY YOU UNDER ANY ORDERS, (2) EITHER PARTY’S EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT, OR (3) YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 12 (RESTRICTIONS) OR SECTION 2 (COMBINING THE PRODUCTS WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE) OF THIRD PARTY CODE IN ATLANTIVE CLOUD SERVICES). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NO SUPPLIERS OF ANY THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCTS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER. The parties agree that the limitations specified in this Section 14 (Limitation of Liability) will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

**15 Third Party Vendor Products**. Atlantive or third parties may from time to time make available to you third-party products or services, including but not limited to add-ons and plugins as well as implementation, customization, training, and other consulting services. If you procure any of these third party products or services, you do so under a separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely between you and the third party vendor. Atlantive does not warrant or support non-Atlantive products or services, whether or not they are designated by Atlantive as “verified” or otherwise, and disclaims all liability for such products or services. If you install or enable any third party products or services for use with Atlantive products, you acknowledge that Atlantive may allow the vendors of those products and services to access Your Data as required for the interoperation and support of such add-ons with the Atlantive products. Atlantive shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Your Data resulting from any such access by third party add-on vendors.

**16 Publicity Rights**. We may identify you as an Atlantive customer in our promotional materials. You may request that we stop doing so by submitting an email to atlantiveHQ@atlantive.com at any time. Please note that it may take us up to 30 days to process your request.

**17 Improving Our Cloud Services**. We are always striving to improve our Cloud Service. In order to do so, we need to measure, analyze, and aggregate how users interact with our Cloud Service, such as usage patterns and characteristics of our user base. We collect and use analytics data regarding the use of our Products as described in our Privacy Policy.

**18 Governing Law; Jurisdiction Resolution**. These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws for the time being in force in the State of New South Wales (Australia) and the parties agree to submit to the non exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales (Australia). 

**19 Export Restrictions**.  You acknowledge that the Cloud Services, or portion thereof may be subject to the export control laws of Australia.  You will not export, re-export, divert, transfer or disclose any portion of the Cloud Services or any related technical information or materials, directly or indirectly, in violation of any applicable export law or regulation. 

**20 Changes to this Agreement**. We may update or modify this Agreement from time to time, including any referenced policies and other documents. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact you designate in the applicable Order, posting on our blog, through your Atlantive account, or in the Product itself). If we modify the Agreement during your Subscription Term, the modified version will be effective upon your next renewal of a Subscription Term.  In this case, if you object to the updated Agreement, as your exclusive remedy, you may choose not to renew, including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. With respect to No-Charge Cloud Services, accepting the updated Agreement is required for you to continue using the No-Charge Cloud Services. You may be required to click through the updated Agreement to show your acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Agreement after it becomes effective, you will no longer have a right to use No-Charge Cloud Services. For the avoidance of doubt, any Order is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of the Order.

**21 General Provisions**. Any notice under this Agreement must be given via email. We may provide notice to you via email. Our notices to you will be deemed given upon the first business day after we send it. You may provide notice to us by email to AtlantiveHQ@Atlantive.com. Your notices to us will be deemed given upon our receipt. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events which are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency. You may not assign this Agreement without our prior written consent. We will not unreasonably withhold our consent if the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. We may assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part) without your consent. The Cloud Services were developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Atlantive relating to the Cloud Services and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Cloud Services or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may not be modified or amended by you without our written agreement (which may be withheld in our complete discretion without any requirement to provide any explanation). As used herein, “including” (and its variants) means “including without limitation” (and its variants). No failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create any duty or obligation of the other party.

**Privacy Policy**

Effective starting: October 1, 2016

**_Introduction_**

This Privacy Policy explains what information Atlantive Pty Ltd and its related entities ("Atlantive") collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the content you place in our Cloud Services. It also explains the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

	•	Atlantive products or services for which a separate privacy policy is 
	        provided.
	•	Third Party Products. These are third party products or services that you 
	        may choose to integrate with Atlantive product or services, such as third 
		party collaboration services.  You should always review the policies of 
		third party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with the 
		ways in which they collect and use your information.
	
A "Device" is any computer used to access the Atlantive Cloud Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.  By registering for or using Atlantive Cloud Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

Definitions

Information: all of the different forms of data, content, and information collected by us as described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information: information that may be used to readily identify or contact you as an individual person, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. Personal Information does not include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow for the ready identification of specific individuals.

_SaaS Products_: Atlantive's "Cloud Services” hosted solutions. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Atlantive Cloud Service displays a link to a different privacy policy, then that other privacy policy shall apply.

_Websites_: Atlantive's websites, including but not limited to Atlantive.com and any related websites, sub-domains and pages.

Changes to our Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the "Effective Starting" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a notice on the Atlantive Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use Atlantive Cloud Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to stop using Atlantive Cloud Services and cancel your use and/or subscription of the Atlantive Cloud Services.

**_Information you provide to us_**

We collect the following information:

_Account and Profile Information_: We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with the Atlantive Cloud Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). Information we collect includes:

	•	Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and 
	        phone number
	•	Billing information such as credit card details and billing address
	•	Profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title
	•	Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences
	
You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Atlantive Services.  In some cases another user (such as a system administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including Personal Information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our Cloud Services). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

_Content_: We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Cloud Services or Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include ("incidentally-collected Personal Information").

_Other submissions_: We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the Atlantive Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. For example, information regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Atlantive product could be submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums.

**_Information we collect from your use of Atlantive Services_**

_Web Logs_: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and SaaS Could Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. In the case of our SaaS Cloud Services, the URLs you accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as elements of Content (such as Idea and Datapoint definitions and values) as necessary for the SaaS Cloud Services to perform the requested operations. Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve Atlantive Cloud Services for individual customers. In such a case, we would treat the combined Information in accordance with this privacy policy.

_Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Cloud Services_: We collect analytics information when you use our Websites and SaaS Cloud Services to help us improve our Services. In the SaaS Cloud Services, this analytics information consists of the feature and function of the Atlantive Cloud Service being used, the associated domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the Atlantive Cloud Services are being affected. 

The analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlantive Cloud Service.

Analytics Information Derived from Content. Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of Cloud Services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of capabilities that users, or we may query Content to determine the most popular job titles of our application users in order to better understand the composition of our user base.

Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.

We use cookies to improve and customize Atlantive Cloud Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Cloud Services without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS Cloud Services are most popular.

**_Acceptable Use Policy_**

Effective starting: October 1, 2016

Here at Atlantive, our goal is to keep you, your teams and your ideas connected.  To do this, we need to keep our Cloud Services running smoothly, quickly, and without distraction. For this to happen, we need help from you, our users. We need you not to misuse or abuse the Atlantive Cloud Services.

To describe exactly what we mean by “misuse” or “abuse” – and help us identify such transgressions, and react accordingly – we’ve created this Acceptable Use Policy. Under this policy, we reserve the right to remove content that is inconsistent with the spirit of the guidelines, even if it’s something that is not forbidden by the letter of the policy. In other words, if you do something that isn’t listed here verbatim, but it looks or smells like something listed here, we may still remove it.

You’ll see the word “Cloud Services” a lot throughout this page. That refers to all websites owned or operated by Atlantive (such as Atlantive.com and any related websites, sub-domains and pages).

Use your judgment, and let’s be kind to each other so we can keep creating great things. You can find all the legal fine print at the bottom of this page.
