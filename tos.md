Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information Atlantive Pty Ltd and its related entities ("Atlantive") collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the content you place in our Cloud Services. It also explains the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

	•	Third Party Products. These are third party products or services that you may choose to integrate with
	        Atlantive product or services, such as third party collaboration services.  You should always review

**_Information you provide to us_**

We collect the following information:

_Account and Profile Information_: We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with the Atlantive Cloud Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). Information we collect includes:

	•	Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and 
	        phone number
	•	Billing information such as credit card details and billing address
	•	Profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title

You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Atlantive Services.  In some cases another user (such as a system administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including Personal Information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our Cloud Services). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

_Content_: We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Cloud Services or Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include ("incidentally-collected Personal Information").

_Other submissions_: We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the Atlantive Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. For example, information regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Atlantive product could be submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums.

**_Information we collect from your use of Atlantive Services_**

_Web Logs_: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and SaaS Could Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. In the case of our SaaS Cloud Services, the URLs you accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as elements of Content (such as Idea and Datapoint definitions and values) as necessary for the SaaS Cloud Services to perform the requested operations. Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve Atlantive Cloud Services for individual customers. In such a case, we would treat the combined Information in accordance with this privacy policy.

_Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Cloud Services_: We collect analytics information when you use our Websites and SaaS Cloud Services to help us improve our Services. In the SaaS Cloud Services, this analytics information consists of the feature and function of the Atlantive Cloud Service being used, the associated domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the Atlantive Cloud Services are being affected. 

The analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlantive Cloud Service.

Analytics Information Derived from Content. Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of Cloud Services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of capabilities that users, or we may query Content to determine the most popular job titles of our application users in order to better understand the composition of our user base.

Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.

_Cookies_: Atlantive uses cookies to collect information. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use cookies to improve and customize Atlantive Cloud Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Cloud Services without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS Cloud Services are most popular. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Websites or SaaS Cloud Services. 

Atlantive may also also use javascript, e-tags, "flash cookies", and HTML5 local storage to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. Many browsers include their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage objects.

You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements as described below under "Your Choices."

_Information from third party services_: We also obtain information from third parties and combine that with Information we collect through Atlantive Cloud Services. For example, we may have access to certain information from a third party social media or authentication service if you log into Atlantive Cloud Services through the service or otherwise provide us with access to Information from the service. Any access that we may have to such Information from a third party social or authentication service is in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by that service. By authorizing us to connect with a third party service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the third party service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
