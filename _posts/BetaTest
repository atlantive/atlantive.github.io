Today Atlantive launched our first product BETA programme.  The programme is in limited release and is intended for:
* MVP testing of our product concepts
* creating and updating ideas
* creating and updating data points e.g. calls per month
* linking datapoints to ideas and creating a hypothesis e.g. reduce calls per month by 10% in 3 months
* Link to Slack for collaboration via simple webhook integration
* Create new users

The MVP is Free of Charge for a period of 3 months after which you can decide to continue to use the product for 3 users Free of Charge.  Additional users would be charged at AU$25 pupm.
